### SPX and VIX time series prediction with multiple regression algorithms

Daily prediction of SPX return and VIX level based on the time series and economic and finance variables. Multiple ML algorithms are used with AutoML to optimize the performance. <br><br>
This method can be used for other index funcs, ETFs (SPY, VOO, QQQ, ...), and single stock (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, ...) level/return prediction.
